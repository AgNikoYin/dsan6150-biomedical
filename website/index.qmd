# Predicting Aids Patient Survival with Different Treatment

[![](figures/aids_pic.png)](https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/hiv-aids/)

## Introduction

### Background

  HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a virus that attacks the immune system by targeting white blood cells, making the body more vulnerable to illnesses like tuberculosis, infections, and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV can progress over time to its most severe stage, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal fluids, and can also be passed from mother to child.[1](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids#:~:text=Human%20immunodeficiency%20virus%20(HIV)%20is,to%20have%20advanced%20HIV%20disease)

The symptom and signs are as follows:

* fever

* headache

* rash

* sore throat

### Data sources

- [Data URL](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/890/aids+clinical+trials+group+study+175)

- It’s a public dataset contains records of patients who were diagnosis with AIDS.
  
- The data contained 2139 intances, include integer and catugoriacal variables

### Project Goal

  The goal of this project is to predict Aids patient treatment failure (death) or survival (censoring) with a certain window of time by comparing two different treatments and looking at the clinical factors such as patient demographics, treatment indicators, and clinical factors such as CD4 counts and Karnofsky scores.

### Methods

* Survival Analysis

* Logistic Regression

* Logic Regression

* Decision Tree

Methodology that will be included in this project would be survival analysis and machine learning methods. Kaplan-Meier Estimator and survival curve will help to compare the difference of using two treatments by visualizing probability of survival over time. The prediction models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree will be used to predict the patients’ survival outcome. The evaluation of models will also proceed during the model development.

### Questions to address

1. How do patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, baseline health status) influence the effectiveness of different treatment methods on survival outcomes?
2. What clinical features (e.g., CD4 counts, Karnofsky score) significantly impact survival outcomes for patients undergoing different treatments?
  - Which combination of CD4 counts and Karnofsky scores provides the most accurate prediction of patient outcomes for each treatment method?
3. Which treatment method would be better?
  - How do patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, baseline health status) influence the effectiveness of different treatment methods on survival outcomes?
4. What are the most important indicators/features that better give the diagnois result?
  - What are the most significant clinical factors influencing patient survival when considering CD cell counts and treatment methods?
5. what is the best model to predict the diagnosis result?

## Survival Analysis

By applying Survival Analysis, we want to answer the following questions:

1. What are the survival probabilities associated with different treatment methods?

2. How do clinical indicators or demographic factors affect survival outcomes?

We focus on estimating survival probabilities and comparing different groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox Proportional Hazards model.

### Kaplan-Meier
1. Analyze Survival Probabilities Across Treatments

![Kaplan-Meier Curve for All Treatments](figures/survival/surv_plot_1.png){width=600 height=400}

- trt=0 showing a significant worse outcomes compared to the other three treatments indicating by the p-value < 0.0001.

- Patients who toke trt=1, trt=2, and trt=3 shows similar survival curves.

2. Focus on Effective Treatments: Survival Differences in trt=1,2,3

![Kaplan-Meier Curve for Treatments 1, 2, and 3](figures/survival/surv_plot_2.png){width=700 height=400}

- The survival probabilities across these treatments are nearly indistinguishable according to the p-value = 0.4.
- This similarity implies that external factors -- other than treatments themselves --may play a role in shaping the survival outcomes.

3. Explore Factors That Affect Survival Probabilities Using the Bootstrap Method

Gender: 

- For trt=0, gender significantly impacts survival probabilities (p-value = 0.024), with female showing higher survival probabilities. 
- Gender differences are less significant for trt=1, trt=2, and trt=3 (p-values = 0.35, 0.061, and 0.79).

![Survival Curves Stratified by Gender](figures/survival/surv_plot_3.png){width=1000 height=700}

ARV History:

- ARV history means the whether the patient has ever taken the antiretroviral treatments, which is the treatment of HIV/AIDS involves treatment of opportunistic infections, prophylaxis, and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy.
- Using trt=1, antiretroviral history (naive vs. experienced) does not significantly impact survival outcomes for patients.
- Using trt=0, trt=2, and trt=3, ARV history has a substantial impact on survival probabilities. Patients with prior ARV treatment show significantly lower survival probabilities compared to naive patients due to the impact of drug resistance.

![Survival Curves Stratified by ARV History](figures/survival/surv_plot_5.png){width=1000 height=700}

Symptom

- For trt=0 and trt=3, the p-values (0.11 and 0.38) indicate no statistically significant difference in survival probabilities between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
- For trt=1, the p-value (0.0039) shows a significant difference, where asymptomatic patients exhibit slightly better survival probabilities compared to symptomatic patients.

![Survival Curves Stratified by Symptom](figures/survival/surv_plot_6.png){width=1000 height=700}

Karnofsky Score

- Karnofsky score measures a patient's functional status on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better physical capability and ability to carry out daily activities.
- There is no significant difference in survival probabilities for patients using treatment 0, 1, and 3.
- Karnofsky score quartiles significantly impact survival probabilities (p = 0.038), with higher quartiles (Q3 and Q4) associated with improved survival outcomes if patients receiving trt=2.

![Survival Curves Stratified by Karnofsky Quantile](figures/survival/surv_plot_8.png){width=1000 height=700}

CD4 at Baseline

- The CD4 cell count is a critical measure of immune system health, which reflects the number of CD4 T-helper cells in the blood, which are essential for immune function.
- There is a consistent and significant impact of CD4 quartiles on survival probabilities across all treatment groups: survival probabilities significantly improve with higher CD4 quantiles, saying that immune status is a key determinant of survival outcomes for all groups and patients with higher CD4 consistently demonstrate better survival probabilities.

### Cox Proportional Hazard Models

- The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves provide a fundational view of survival probabilities by visualizing unadjusted survival outcomes across different strata.
- The Cox proportional hazards model is a semi-parametric approach that allows for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple covariates. And it can adjust for confounding factors, ensuring a clearer understanding of each variable's independent effect on survival.

## Logistic Regression
### Model Analysis

The dataset we are using in this analysis are the filtered and scaled version of the original dataset, we first scaled all  continues variables, and then filtered all observation with time larger than 950 to prevent issues of the unbalance dataset will bring to the prediction model.  

![](figures/eda/eda_plot_2.png){width=80%}

At time = 950, we have a similar sizes of patients with Cid=0 and Cid = 1.
The original dataset has 2139 observations, 24 variables, and the modifed data has 851 observation.

### Feature Impoartance

`offtrt`,  `cd420`, `race`,  `hemo`,  `symptom`, `drugs`, `gender`, `cd820`,  `age`, `strat`.

`offtrt` and `cd420` are strong predictors of survival, showing a negative impact when their respective conditions worsen.
`age` and `cd820` show positive associations with survival, highlighting potential protective effects or favorable prognostic indicators.
These insights could inform clinical interventions by emphasizing the need to prioritize treatment adherence and monitor biomarkers like `cd420` and `cd820`.

After feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the final model achieved an improved accuracy of 76.86%.
Sensitivity (78.10%) improved, indicating better performance in identifying true positives.
The specificity (76.00%) remained consistent, reflecting reliable identification of true negatives.
